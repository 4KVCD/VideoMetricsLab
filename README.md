# VideoMetricsLab

A Windows desktop app for measuring and comparing video encode quality.

## Videos

Configure each test independently, inspect its codec and bitrate, and calculate
multiple quality metrics in one run.

## Metric graphs

Compare real per-frame curves and distribution statistics. The frame readout
shows both test values and their signed delta at the same moment.

## Video Compare

Switch instantly between the reference and test encodes during playback, or
seek to an exact frame for close inspection.

## Bitrate Viewer

Analyze video-only bitrate independently by frame, second, or GOP.

## Features

- Calculate VMAF, VMAF NEG, PSNR, SSIM, XPSNR, SSIMULACRA2, and Butteraugli
  for multiple test videos.
- Accelerate SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli with Vship on supported NVIDIA/AMD
  GPUs; automatically use the bundled libjxl CPU tools when GPU scoring is
  unavailable.
- Use the bundled Netflix VMAF v1 models for standard, phone, 4K, and HFR viewing scenarios.
- Compare metric curves, statistics, and per-frame scores.
- Instant switch between source and encoded video for easy visual A/B comparisons, both frame by frame and during playback, and between different encoded videos.
- Inspect bitrate by frame, second, or GOP without running quality metrics.
- Detect black bars and handle resolution mismatches automatically.
- Use GPU decoding when supported, with independent software fallback per input.
- Calculate two test videos in parallel on many-core CPUs.
- Cache completed results and restore them when matching videos are loaded again.

## Quick start

1. Select a reference video.
2. Add one or more test videos.
3. Choose the metrics to calculate.
4. Click **Calculate metrics**.

Results appear in the video table and Metric Graphs tab as each test finishes.
Video Compare and Bitrate Viewer can also be used without calculating metrics.

For detailed instructions, see the [User Guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md).

## Install

### Packaged release

Download the Windows zip from the [latest release](https://github.com/4KVCD/VideoMetricsLab/releases/latest),
extract it, and run `VideoMetricsLab.exe`.

The app requires **FFmpeg 9 or newer with libvmaf**. FFmpeg is not bundled; the
app prompts for its location if it is not available on `PATH`.

### Run from source

Requires Python 3.11 or newer:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m vmaf_app.main
```

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- FFmpeg 9+ with `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, and `libvmaf`
- Optional NVIDIA, Intel, or AMD GPU for hardware decoding.
- Optional supported NVIDIA/AMD GPU and driver runtime for accelerated
  SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli; CPU calculation works without one.
- Python 3.11+ when running from source

## Development

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check vmaf_app tests scripts
```

Build the distributable with `./scripts/build_release.ps1`. See the
[build guide](docs/BUILD.md) and [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.
