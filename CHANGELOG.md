# Changelog

## v1.2.1

- Added a VMAF v1 column with its own model list. The existing VMAF column is
  now labelled VMAF v0.6.1, and scores saved by earlier versions still load.
  VMAF v1's Auto model is chosen by the resolution the videos are compared
  at: 4K and above uses the 4K / 1.5H model, because 1.5 screen heights is the
  standard viewing distance for 4K (VMAF v0.6.1's 4K model uses it too).
  Anything below 4K uses the 1080p / 3H model, the standard distance for HD.
- Reworked the run status: each video shows its CPU and GPU metrics progress
  separately, with elapsed time and a more accurate queue ETA, plus many
  related bug fixes.
- Cancelling a run will now keep the metrics a video had already finished.
- Cancelling a run will now stay on the Videos tab rather than jump to the
  Metric Graphs tab.
- Video Compare no longer re-checks the reference each time a different test
  video is picked.
- Fixed saved VMAF scores not loading on rows set to VMAF model Auto.
- Fixed the metrics ticked in the Videos tab column headers being unticked
  after a restart.
- Included various small bug fixes and reliability improvements.

## v1.2

- Added GPU support for ColorVideo VDP, SSIMULACRA2, and Butteraugli with
  Vship integration.
- Added CPU fallback for SSIMULACRA2 and Butteraugli with libjxl. ColorVideo
  VDP has no CPU fallback.
- Added CVVDP per-second scores and graphing alongside its whole-video score.
- Added an Add/remove metrics control to the Videos tab so metric columns can
  be shown or hidden, and new metrics can be added to completed analyses
  without recalculating existing results.
- Included various small under-the-hood bug fixes and reliability improvements.

## v1.1.1

- Fixed the metric graph clipping VMAF v1 scores above 100.
- Show the application version in the window title: VideoMetricsLab 1.1.1.
- Omit calculation-library version metadata from non-VMAF cache entries

## v1.1

- Added bundled Netflix VMAF v1.0 model files, including standard, 4K, phone,
  and HFR variants.
- Refactored metric execution around a shared registry and backend plan.
- Added per-metric results, provenance, and cache identities so saved results
  remain tied to the exact metric implementation and settings.
- Improved graph/readout handling for the generalized metric architecture.
